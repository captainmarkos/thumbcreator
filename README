When I upload pictures from my digital camera, the image sizes are quite 
large.  Also, I want to keep all the original pictures in their original 
format (not photoshopped).  So I created a little program that will simply
create thumbnail images from a directory of images (mostly the directory 
of images uploaded from my camera).  The thumbnail size can be set to your
preference.  I usually use 1200x900 or 1024x768.

The original images are preserved.

Happy Trails!
